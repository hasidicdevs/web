# HDG (חד"ג)

## Hasidic Development Group

We are (*as the name suggests*) a group of hasidic developers, although some of the members of our group are not hasidic or even jewish.... Currently we have five members and we work as a team to help contribute to open source projects on github, we all work together to create websites, applications and do graphic designs for those who need them. We welcome new programmers to [join our team](/careers) and grow with us into a robust web company. 

Membership begins with joining our discord server and getting to know us, then if you decide you would like to join and work with us you simply submit an application in the #joining-hdg channel. One of the members of the @hdg/hr team will reach out to you and invite you into a #interview room where you go through the process. If you are selected to be a member of our company we will assign you roles in discord and invite you to the repo and teams on github.
