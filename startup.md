## About Us

Thank you for stopping by our site, we are a small business startup. We are in the soft launch phase, we are still acquiring employees and partners. While we are in this phase we welcome you to join our server and learn more about us. We have decided to launch for a one year test period, from Erev Rosh Hashana 5784 - 5785. At that time we will hold our annual meeting of board members (Which can be viewed publicly in the [hdg-meetings](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/hdg-meetings) repo) and discuss our plans, whether we will incorporate, or dissolve.

We are unique in our business in that we keep **everything** public. All of our source code, all of our internals, all of our client code, everything. We brand this an "[open source business](docs/business/model)" we have no plans to change this in the future. We envision a business model where *"many hands make light work"*. Our client code is public because we do not know everything, so when a member of the GitHub community sees a flaw in our code they are free to fork that repo, change the code and push those changes to us. 

Of course we have an internal process to determine whether or not to accept that PR or not, but it reduces our workload significantly. For now we are an LLC licensed in the state of NY, but at our annual meeting in January we will decide to incorporate and file the appropriate papers needed for that. You can view all of our business papers in the [hdg-biz](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/hdg-biz) repo or right here on our site. They are listed below for ease of access.

## Business Papers

These are the founding forms for our business. We are remote workers from all over North America so our papers reflect that type of business model. We keep all of our work open source as well so we include that in our agreements and legal info. You can change any of these to fit your needs.

- [Articles of Organization:](docs/business/articles)
- [Partnership Agreement:](docs/business/partners)
- [Operating Agreement:](docs/business/operating)
- [Mission Statement](docs/business/mission)
- [Business Model](docs/business/model)
- [Business Plan](docs/business/plan)
- [By Laws](docs/business/bylaws)

If you are an investor looking for your next business to invest in we would seriously appreciate it and we will compensate you in time. If you are a developer looking to join an amazing company then search our [open positions](/careers) and please reach out.
