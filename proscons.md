# Pros & Cons 
## Hiring A Professional

**PROS:**

- No need to spend hours, days or weeks trying to learn the technology required to build and operate a website.
- You’ll get a modern, professional website you’re proud of … one that accurately represents your company and your brand.
- Visitors will have a good experience on all devices — desktop, tablet & mobile.
- They can help you manage your site once it’s launched.
- They can develop your site’s content and overcome the curse of knowledge. The curse of knowledge is when you can’t remember what it’s like to not know everything you know. Thus, you omit critical information from your site because you assume everyone already knows what you know — when they really don’t.
- They can recommend ideas and help you avoid pitfalls you probably wouldn’t have thought of yourself

**CONS:**

- Will require an investment of several thousand dollars (most likely in the $5k-10k range) to create a new site from scratch or redesign an existing site.
- If you don’t understand web technology, you will be somewhat dependent on your website designer/developer to manage your site after it launches.
