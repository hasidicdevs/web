## Marketing Strategy:

We will use a combination of online marketing channels to promote our services and reach our target market. Our online marketing channels will include search engine optimization, social media marketing, and targeted email campaigns. We will primarily use twitter and github for our online social media. We employ a Social Media Manager to maintain those accounts socially.

## Financial Plan:

Our revenue will primarily come from the fees we charge for our web development services, which are layed out in the "Services" page on our site. We will also generate additional revenue through ongoing website maintenance, support services, and add ons, like email marketing, social media marketing, and website speed optimization. Our financial projections indicate that we will achieve profitability in our first year, since this is an open source project and we are all online for now, there are no overhead fees and costs to worry about except for the costs of servers and licenses which members already pay for out of their own pocket so everything is profit at this point.

## Conclusion:

At **Hasidic Development Group**, we are committed to delivering high-quality, reliable, and secure web development solutions that meets and exceeds our clients' expectations. We believe that our focus on innovative and customized web development services will enable us to differentiate ourselves in a crowded market and achieve success in this fast paced environment.
