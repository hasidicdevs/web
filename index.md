# Welcome To Hasidic.Dev

The <strong>"Hasidic Development Group"</strong> on discord and github. We are a group of developers who hang out on discord and code with one another. We listen to music, chat about topics that interest us and welcome new people to join us in our journey. If you are looking for a web design or an application to be built use the email on the side and get in touch with us. If you need assistance on an open source repository, just raise an issue on github and use our tags to get our attention.

## @hasidicdev Teams

We use github a lot for open source collaboration on code. For that reason we decided to use teams as a way to collaborate across github. You just use the tag for the team you need to help you and we will respond as soon as we get the notification.
