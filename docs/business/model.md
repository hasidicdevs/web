## Open Source Business

We practice what we personally term as an Open Source business, this means all of our revenue, all our code, all of our meetings are all open to members of the community. We mainly operate as a business on Discord, this gives us access to a few tools internally that help us with organization and structuring. We use "Stages" and "Voice chats" for meetings. We use "Forums" for keeping track of bugs and features. We use "Roles" to keep track of employees. 

This isnt going to work for all companies but if you have the right group you can also work like this. We have a few open positions on our team and would love to have more people join us. If you would like to work for a company like this you can join our discord channel and get to know us. After that start browsing our [legal documents](/documentation) and start asking questions about how to join this brand new company. You can read more about open source business and how we do it on our [blog]()

### [Articles of Organization](articles)

The articles of organization, also known as a certificate of organization, is a legal document that establishes the existence of a limited liability company (LLC). It's typically filed with the state government agency responsible for registering businesses, such as the Secretary of State.

The articles of organization usually include basic information about the LLC, such as its name, address, and purpose, as well as details about the ownership structure, management, and governance of the company. This may include the names and addresses of the LLC's members, the name of the LLC's registered agent, and the duration of the LLC.

In general, the articles of organization serve as the foundational document for the LLC, and they provide important information to the public and to government agencies about the business. In some states, the articles of organization may be required to include additional information, so it's important to consult the relevant state laws and regulations when preparing the document.

### [Partnership Agreement](partners)

A partnership agreement is a legal document that establishes the terms and conditions for a partnership between two or more individuals or entities. It sets out the rules for how the partners will conduct business together, how profits and losses will be shared, and how the partnership will be managed.

The partnership agreement typically includes information about the partnership's name and purpose, the contributions of each partner, the distribution of profits and losses, the decision-making process, and the procedures for admitting new partners or transferring ownership. It may also cover issues such as dispute resolution, confidentiality, and the termination of the partnership.

The partnership agreement serves as a key document for the partnership and helps to ensure that all partners are on the same page about how the business will be run. It can help to prevent misunderstandings and disputes by clearly outlining each partner's responsibilities and rights. A well-drafted partnership agreement is important for any partnership, as it helps to establish a solid foundation for the business and can provide a framework for its ongoing success.

### [Operating Agreement](operating)

An operating agreement is a legal document that outlines the management structure and operating procedures of a company, typically a limited liability company (LLC). It's essentially a contract among the members of the company that establishes the rules and guidelines for how the business will be run, how profits and losses will be shared, and how the company will be managed.

The operating agreement typically includes information about the ownership structure of the company, the roles and responsibilities of the members, the procedures for decision-making and voting, the distribution of profits and losses, and the processes for admitting new members or transferring ownership.

In general, an operating agreement serves to establish clear expectations and guidelines for the operation of the company and to protect the interests of all parties involved. It's typically a key document for any LLC and is often required by state law.

### [Mission Statement](mission)

A mission statement is a brief statement that communicates the purpose and values of an organization. It's typically a concise, one-sentence declaration that summarizes the organization's reason for existence and its core beliefs and principles.

A mission statement is often used as a guiding principle for the organization's decision-making processes, strategies, and goals. It helps to define the organization's purpose and direction, and provides a framework for measuring its success.

An effective mission statement is clear, concise, and memorable. It should communicate the organization's goals and values in a way that inspires and motivates its employees, customers, and stakeholders. A well-crafted mission statement can help to establish a strong brand identity and can serve as a rallying cry for the organization's supporters and advocates.

### [Business Plan](plan)

A business plan is a comprehensive document that outlines the goals, strategies, and operations of a new or existing business. It's typically used to help guide the development and growth of the business, and to secure funding from investors, banks, or other sources.

A typical business plan includes a description of the business and its products or services, an analysis of the target market and competition, a marketing and sales plan, a description of the management team and organization, a financial plan and projections, and an overview of the risks and challenges that the business may face.

A well-crafted business plan serves as a roadmap for the business, providing a framework for decision-making and a guide for achieving the company's goals. It helps to identify potential problems and opportunities, and provides a foundation for securing funding and other resources.

In addition, a business plan can be a valuable tool for communicating the company's vision and goals to employees, customers, and other stakeholders. It can help to establish a sense of focus and purpose for the business, and can provide a benchmark for measuring its success.

### [By Laws](bylaws)

Business bylaws, also known as corporate bylaws, are a set of rules and procedures that govern the internal operations of a corporation. They typically outline the rights and responsibilities of the company's shareholders, directors, and officers, and provide guidelines for how the company will be managed and operated.

Some of the topics that may be covered by business bylaws include:

- The roles and responsibilities of the company's officers, directors, and committees
- The procedures for holding meetings, making decisions, and taking actions on behalf of the corporation
- The process for electing and removing directors and officers
- The procedures for issuing and transferring stock
- The rules for how the company will be governed and operated, including its financial and accounting practices

Business bylaws are typically adopted by the corporation's board of directors, and may be amended as needed by a vote of the shareholders or directors. They are an important document for any corporation, as they help to ensure that the company is operated in a consistent and effective manner, and that the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved are clearly defined.
