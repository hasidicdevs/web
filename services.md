## Pricing

### Website Design

Pricing your website begins with deciding on what type of site you need. Whether it be a [SPA](#spa---single-page-application) (like an **extension** for a browser, a **bot** for your website or discord server, or a **web app**), a [static website](#responsive-web-design), or a [dynamic](#dynamic-website-design) one, we want to keep the cost to a minimum and also provide you with an amazing website that will turn into profit for you and your business. It is too difficult to really determine the pricing of your site on a web page, but in general it will cost somewhere between $500 (for a simple static 5 page website with media) up to $5,000 and sometimes even [more](#pros--cons-hiring-a-professional) depending on the amount of work involved. 

**Design Flow:** Along with your design package you will recieve a link to the developers dashboard tracker that will show you in real time how much work has been done on your site. We will also email you daily with an update and screenshots of how it is going. To start the process get in touch with us today by filling out our [contact form](/contact)

## Types of Website

### Responsive Web Design

A responsive website is simply a website that will respond to changes from the user. Whether that be by `user-agent` such as mobile, desktop, or tablet or some other means we will design you a beautiful website using the most modern CSS / HTML principles and design methods to ensure it is fast and has all the information you need to be presented to users.

### Dynamic Website Design

A *dynamic web page* is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. This can be accomplished using multiple languages, we focus on **jQuery**, **Node.js**, and **Ruby**. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client-side processing based on user interaction with the page.

### SPA - Single Page Application

An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown. This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

## Pros & Cons: Hiring A Professional

**PROS:**

- No need to spend hours, days or weeks trying to learn the technology required to build and operate a website.
- You’ll get a modern, professional website you’re proud of … one that accurately represents your company and your brand.
- Visitors will have a good experience on all devices — desktop, tablet & mobile.
- They can help you manage your site once it’s launched.
- They can develop your site’s content and overcome the curse of knowledge. The curse of knowledge is when you can’t remember what it’s like to not know everything you know. Thus, you omit critical information from your site because you assume everyone already knows what you know — when they really don’t.
- They can recommend ideas and help you avoid pitfalls you probably wouldn’t have thought of yourself

**CONS:**

- Will require an investment of several thousand dollars (most likely in the $5k-10k range) to create a new site from scratch or redesign an existing site.
- If you don’t understand web technology, you will be somewhat dependent on your website designer/developer to manage your site after it launches.
