## Pricing

### Website Design

Pricing your website begins with deciding on what type of site you need. Whether it be a SPA (like an **extension** for a browser, a **bot** for your website or discord server, or a **web app**), a static website, or a dynamic one, we want to keep the cost to a minimum and also provide you with an amazing website that will turn into profit for you and your business. It is too difficult to really determine the pricing of your site on a web page, but in general it will cost somewhere between $500 (for a simple static 5 page website with media) up to $5,000 and sometimes even more depending on the amount of work involved.
