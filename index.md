# Hasidic.Dev />

Welcome to the website for the **"Hasidic Development Group"** on discord and github. We are a group of developers who hang out on discord and code with one another. We are a small business [startup](/startup) providing web design services. We listen to music, chat about topics that interest us and welcome new people to join us in our journey as we code together. If you are looking for a web design or an application to be built you can find a description of our services we provide and the pricing models we use on the [services page](/services)

## About Us

We met online on Discord and decided to combine our skills and work on building a web development company that not only offers amazing website designs, but we also offer a unique opportunity for our customers to join us in the chat and walk through the steps of the process and watch their site being built daily. All of our developers work in an editor with the "WakaTime" plugin installed which means once your project is assigned to a developer you will be able to go to their dashboard and see exactly how long they have been working on your site as we work on it. 

We involve you in the process of selecting the best content, media to use on your site, plugins you may need, or anything else you can imagine. We are there all the time (except on Shabbat) and we are always available if there is an issue on your site. We also offer premium services such as site maintenance and upkeep and you don't have to worry about anything. Let us ensure your site is up and running all the time.

## Communicate With The Team

We have multiple means of communication to assist you. We have forums on github ([@hdg/Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/hasidicdevs/discussions)), project boards ([@hdg-web](https://github.com/orgs/hasidicdevs/projects/2), [@hdg-bot](https://github.com/orgs/hasidicdevs/projects/4)), and discord ([hdg-discord](https://discord.com/invite/mWepccFCQh)) for instant communication. If you prefer to use email you can find multiple addresses on this site to reach the developers and maintainers of our repos or go to our [contact page](/contact) and submit an email using the form there.
