## Documentation Repo

These are the various documents we use for our projects. These are here as a handy resource that is easy to read. Templates for issues (`Bug Reports`, `Feature Requests`, and `Pull Requests`) are here as well as a header template to use for Javascript files and a style guide to use in our projects. Just change the info to your own and use it as you need. Our header template is based on the Python style guide for header templates but we like it because it is descriptive. 

Our [style guidelines](docs/style) are based on the AirBNB Javascript Style Guide on Github. These are documents we have available in our main [hdg-docs](https://github.com/hasidicdevs/hdg-docs) repository. They are pretty standard for all repos to have. You can copy these and use them in your own projects or simply fork the whole repo into your `docs` branch and push the change. Then presto it will be in your project too...
