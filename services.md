When it comes time to design a website for your group, business, online shop or whatever your need is there are multiple factors to consider. Let us help walk you through the process of buying the domain name, designing the site and launching it. We have tried to include all the information we need to design you a robust user experience on your own website. When you are ready to go through the process of describing what you need for your site, send us an email to [github@hasidic.dev](mailto:github@hasidic.dev)

## Pricing

### Website Design

Pricing your website begins with deciding on what type of site you need. Whether it be a [SPA](#spa---single-page-application) (like an **extension** for a browser, a **bot** for your website or discord server, or a **web app**), a [static website](#responsive-web-design), or a [dynamic](#dynamic-website-design) one, we want to keep the cost to a minimum and also provide you with an amazing website that will turn into profit for you and your business. It is too difficult to really determine the pricing of your site on a web page, but in general it will cost somewhere between $500 (for a simple static 5 page website with media) up to $5,000 and sometimes even [more](#pros--cons-hiring-a-professional) depending on the amount of work involved.
