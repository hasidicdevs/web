# Types Of Websites

## Responsive Web Design

A responsive website is simply a website that will respond to changes from the user. Whether that be by `user-agent` such as mobile, desktop, or tablet or some other means we will design you a beautiful website using the most modern CSS / HTML principles and design methods to ensure it is fast and has all the information you need to be presented to users.

## Dynamic Website Design

A *dynamic web page* is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. This can be accomplished using multiple languages, we focus on **jQuery**, **Node.js**, and **Ruby**. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client-side processing based on user interaction with the page.

## SPA - Single Page Application

An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown. This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.
