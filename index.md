# Welcome To Hasidic.Dev

Website for the **"Hasidic Development Group"** on discord and github. We are a group of developers who hang out on discord and code with one another. We listen to music, chat about topics that interest us and welcome new people to join us in our journey. If you are looking for a web design or an application to be built use the email on the side and get in touch with us. If you need assistance on an open source repository, just raise an issue on github and use our tags to get our attention. You can find a description of our services we provide and the pricing models we use on the [services page](/services)

## Documentation

You can find a copy of our documentation we use in projects and a few legal notices in the [Docs](/documentation) folder here on the site for easy viewing. This also includes copies of our legal documents and contracts for clients. You can find a copy of this repo in our [public repos](https://github.com/hasidicdevs) listed as **"hdg-docs"**

## Communicate With The Team

We have multiple means of communication to assist you. We have forums on github, project boards, and discord for instant communication. If you prefer to use email you can find multiple addresses on this site to reach the developers and maintainers of our repos.
